## ‚ú® Features

`create-tsxpress` generates projects with a robust, opinionated structure, emphasizing developer experience and production readiness. Key features of the generated template include:

*   **TypeScript Integration**: Leverage strong typing and modern ECMAScript features for robust and maintainable code.
*   **Express.js Framework**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
*   **Production-Ready Structure**: An organized and scalable project layout, promoting modularity and clean architecture.
*   **Enhanced Security**: Integrates `helmet` for HTTP header security, `cors` for cross-origin resource sharing, and `express-rate-limit` to protect against brute-force attacks.
*   **Centralized Error Handling**: Custom middleware for elegant handling of application-specific and unexpected errors, including a `notFoundHandler` and `errorHandler`.
*   **Structured Logging**: Utilizes `winston` for comprehensive and customizable logging, making debugging and monitoring easier.
*   **Environment Configuration**: Seamless integration with `dotenv` for managing sensitive credentials and environment-specific settings.
*   **Developer Experience**: Configured with `nodemon` for automatic server restarts on file changes and `tsconfig-paths` for cleaner import aliases.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use `create-tsxpress` locally to scaffold your new project.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/teajhaney/create-expts.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd create-expts
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

### Usage

Once `create-tsxpress` is installed, you can use it to create a new Express.js and TypeScript project.

1.  **Run the CLI Tool**:
    To use the CLI directly, execute it via `npx` or by running the local development command:

    ```bash
    # Option 1: Using npx (recommended for fresh projects)
    npx create-tsxpress my-new-api

    # Option 2: Running from local development (if you've cloned this repo)
    npm run dev my-new-api
    ```
    Replace `my-new-api` with your desired project directory name.

2.  **Follow the Prompts**:
    The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts to configure your new project.

3.  **Navigate to Your New Project**:
    After the scaffolding is complete, change into your newly created project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-new-api
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies for the New Project**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    # or pnpm install
    ```

5.  **Start Your New Project in Development Mode**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your new Express.js API server will start, typically on port `5000` (configurable via `.env`).
