## ‚ú® Features

`create-tsxpress` generates projects with a robust, opinionated structure, emphasizing developer experience and production readiness. Key features of the generated template include:

- **TypeScript Integration**: Leverage strong typing and modern ECMAScript features for robust and maintainable code.
- **Express.js Framework**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Production-Ready Structure**: An organized and scalable project layout, promoting modularity and clean architecture.
- **Enhanced Security**: Integrates `helmet` for HTTP header security, `cors` for cross-origin resource sharing, and `express-rate-limit` to protect against brute-force attacks.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Custom middleware for elegant handling of application-specific and unexpected errors, including a `notFoundHandler` and `errorHandler`.
- **Structured Logging**: Utilizes `winston` for comprehensive and customizable logging, making debugging and monitoring easier.
- **Environment Configuration**: Seamless integration with `dotenv` for managing sensitive credentials and environment-specific settings.
- **Developer Experience**: Configured with `nodemon` for automatic server restarts on file changes and `tsconfig-paths` for cleaner import aliases.
