## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use `create-expts` to generate your new API project.

### Installation

To use `create-expts` as a global CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g create-expts
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run it without global installation:

```bash
npx create-expts
```

To contribute to `create-expts` development:

```bash
# üëØ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/teajhaney/express-typescript-template.git
cd express-typescript-template

# üì¶ Install dependencies for the CLI tool
npm install

# üõ†Ô∏è Build the CLI tool
npm run build

# üöÄ Run the CLI tool locally for testing
npm run dev
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can generate a new Express + TypeScript project by running:

```bash
npx create-expts my-api-project
```

Or if installed globally:

```bash
create-expts my-api-project
```

The CLI will prompt you to confirm the project name and then scaffold the directory.

```
? Project name: my-api-project
‚ú® Scaffolding project...
```

After successful scaffolding, navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-api-project
```

Then, install its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Your Generated API Project

Your newly generated project comes with convenient scripts:

1.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root of your `my-api-project` directory.

    ```dotenv
    PORT=5000
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

    *   `PORT`: The port your API server will listen on.
    *   `NODE_ENV`: The environment your application is running in (e.g., `development`, `production`).

2.  **Development Mode**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the server with `nodemon`, automatically restarting on file changes.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This compiles your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

4.  **Start Production Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This runs the compiled JavaScript code from the `dist` directory.
